	•	What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
	  Fast-Forward Merge:
  		Simple and linear.
  	  No new merge commit is created.
  		Suitable for cases where the branches have a straightforward, linear history.
	  Recursive Merge:
  		Involves a more complex merging process.
  		Creates a new merge commit with two parents.
  		Necessary when there are divergent changes on both branches.
